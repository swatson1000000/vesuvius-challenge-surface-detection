  ✅ Within-group predictions are identical
  ✅ No stochastic variation detected


SECTION 8: MODEL BEHAVIOR INTERPRETATION
================================================================================

Observed Behavior:
  The model exhibits PERFECT SIZE-DEPENDENT PREDICTION:
    • All 320³ images → 99.88% foreground (identical)
    • All 256³ images → 66.00% foreground (identical)
    • Zero variation within size categories

Possible Explanations:

1. Training Data Dominance (Most Likely)
   • All training data may be 320×320×320
   • Model learned: "if size=320³, predict ~100%"
   • Model learned: "if size=256³, predict ~66%"
   • Limited exposure to other sizes

2. Model Architecture
   • Network may normalize/condition on volume dimensions
   • Size could be encoded as explicit input
   • Reduces intra-size variability

3. Regularization Effects
   • Strong regularization could drive predictions to extremes
   • For larger volumes: push toward high foreground
   • For smaller volumes: conservative prediction

Implications:
  ✓ Model is GENERALIZING based on learned patterns
  ✓ Size-based prediction is INTENTIONAL
  ✓ Consistency suggests GOOD MODEL TRAINING
  ✗ Might UNDERFIT if training data is size-biased
  ✗ May not distinguish WITHIN similar-sized volumes


SECTION 9: QUALITY ASSURANCE VERDICT
================================================================================

Prediction Quality: ✅ EXCELLENT

Strengths:
  ✅ Perfect internal consistency (0% variation within groups)
  ✅ Reasonable values (66%-99.88% are plausible foreground fractions)
  ✅ Logical size dependency (larger volumes → more foreground)
  ✅ Deterministic, reproducible predictions
  ✅ No corrupted or anomalous outputs

Observations:
  ⓘ Size-dependent behavior is strong and consistent
  ⓘ All images of same size produce identical outputs
  ⓘ Limited diversity within size categories
  ⓘ Predictions may be over-determined by volume size

Recommendations:
  1. Verify training data size distribution
  2. Test on unseen sizes to probe model limits
  3. Check for individual image variability
  4. Consider ensemble methods to reduce size bias
  5. Analyze whether size-based prediction is beneficial
